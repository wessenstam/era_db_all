Introductions
+++++++++++++

- Name
- Familiarity with Nutanix

Initial Setup
+++++++++++++

- Take note of the *Passwords* being used.
- Log into your virtual desktops (connection info below)

Cluster assignment
++++++++++++++++++

The instructor will tell the attendees their assigned clusters.

.. note::
  If these are Single Node Clusters (SNCs) pay close attention on the networking part. The SNCs are completely different setup and configured compared to the "normal" three/four node clusters

Environment Details
+++++++++++++++++++

Nutanix Workshops are intended to be run in the Nutanix Hosted POC environment. Your cluster will be provisioned with all necessary images, networks, and VMs required to complete the exercises.

Networking
..........

As we are able to provide three/four node clusters and single node clusters in the HPOC environment, we need to describe each sort of cluster separately. The clusters are setup and configured differently.

Three/Four node HPOC clusters
-----------------------------

Three or four node Hosted POC clusters follow a standard naming convention:

- **Cluster Name** - POC\ *XYZ*
- **Subnet** - 10.\ **21**\ .\ *XYZ*\ .0
- **Cluster IP** - 10.\ **21**\ .\ *XYZ*\ .37

For example:

- **Cluster Name** - POC055
- **Subnet** - 10.38.55.0
- **Cluster IP** - 10.21.55.37 for the VIP of the Cluster


Throughout the Workshop there are multiple instances where you will need to substitute *XYZ* with the correct octet for your subnet, for example:

.. list-table::
  :widths: 25 75
  :header-rows: 1

  * - IP Address
    - Description
  * - 10.38.\ *XYZ*\ .37
    - Nutanix Cluster Virtual IP
  * - 10.38.\ *XYZ*\ .39
    - **PC** VM IP, Prism Central
  * - 10.38.\ *XYZ*\ .41
    - **DC** VM IP, NTNXLAB.local Domain Controller

Each cluster is configured with 2 VLANs which can be used for VMs:

.. list-table::
  :widths: 25 25 10 40
  :header-rows: 1

  * - Network Name
    - Address
    - VLAN
    - DHCP Scope
  * - Primary
    - 10.38.\ *XYZ*\ .1/25
    - 0
    - 10.38.\ *XYZ*\ .50-10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .124
  * - Secondary
    - 10.38.\ *XYZ*\ .129/25
    - *XYZ1*
    - 10.38.\ *XYZ*\ .132-10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .253

Single Node HPOC Clusters
-------------------------

For some workshops we are using Single Node Clusters (SNC). The reason for this is to allow more people to have a dedicated cluster but still have enough free clusters for the bigger workshops including those for customers.

The network in the SNC config is using a /26 network. This splits the network address into four equal sizes that can be used for workshops. The below table describes the setup of the network in the four partitions. It provides essential information for the workshop with respect to the IP addresses and the services running at that IP address.
